## tic-tac-toe
--------------------

- You need two players to play.
- First player gets 'X' as his sign and the second gets 'O'.
- First player to get three consecutive marks on the board wins.
- You can edit the default names(Player1 and Player2) to your own.
- Pressing the start buttons starts a timer of 5 seconds.
- If you do not finish your turn, the opposite player wins.
- On the end of the game, either, the winner name is displayed(if someone wins), or nothing is displayed(if it's a stalemate).
